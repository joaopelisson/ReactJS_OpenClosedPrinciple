# ReactJS | Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ‚öõÔ∏è

This project explores the **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)** within the context of React applications. OCP, one of the SOLID principles, states that software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification. By following OCP, you can create components and modules that are easily extendable without altering existing code, promoting flexibility and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.

**üìù You can compare before and after more explicitly based on the project's (commits) history.**
- [Creating an `input` component to explain, using props with the aim of showing how as it receives new props, it becomes more expensive without applying open/closed](https://github.com/joaopelisson/ReactJS_OpenClosedPrinciple/commit/e514920253a2a7bc87c9f9aa46ea71009db3b8e4#diff-ffdbdeb0bf2f71cac68691bfc84b4c1d49efd0f58bac8d3ffe70bf605705618a)

- [Applying open and closed to it, leaving it simple, and still with the possibility of extending - using children for composition](https://github.com/joaopelisson/ReactJS_OpenClosedPrinciple/commit/7fa674db20718c7dcd539c2655a7537c800bbc91#diff-ffdbdeb0bf2f71cac68691bfc84b4c1d49efd0f58bac8d3ffe70bf605705618a)

## üõ†Ô∏è What is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that help developers create more maintainable and scalable software:

- **S**: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- **O**: Open/Closed Principle (OCP) ‚Äî Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- **L**: Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
- **I**: Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
- **D**: Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

## üéØ Objectives

- Demonstrate how to apply the Open/Closed Principle in React components.
- Show how to extend functionality in React without modifying existing code.
- Provide practical examples of how to structure a React project following OCP best practices.

## üìÇ What You'll Find

- **Code Example**: React components designed to be extended without modification.
- **Extensibility Techniques**: Strategies for adding new features or behaviors by extending existing components.
- **Best Practices**: Tips for ensuring your React codebase remains flexible and robust by adhering to OCP.
